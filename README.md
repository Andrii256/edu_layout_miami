*I deliberately did not use js to better understand css in all its possible possibilities
## Code Description and Features
This is main page of commercial site of estate business. There are 7 main blocks:

**Main screen**
Is second hardes block because of its full screen mode. It was quite difficult to chose styles to it look equal nice on all screens.

**Fast description and Testimonials**
Simple FlexBox blocks.

**Gallery**
Hardest one block. I deliberately implement 'show more' button functionality using CSS. Button connected with `checkbox` using `label for=""` and when user touch button he change state of checkbox. And when checkbox state changes, then changes styles (height) of neiborgh block.

**Consultaions form and Contact us form**
Used correct semantic tags.

**Footer**
Implemented used parallax effect. It has fixed to viewport position and usuall hidden by other body elements. But when user scroll down there are empty space after Contact us form without no content and footer became to visible.
